# Pac-Men-Factory
Making random Pac-Men with random routes with the click of a button, One button allows you to spawn in randomly placed Pac-Men, and another button lets you start their movement based on randomly generated speeds and directions formed in the JavaScript.
## How To Run
Download all files, put in one folder, run pac-men-factory.html on a browser, refresh page and use buttons to run.
## Future Improvements
I would like to add onto this by making the Pac-Men be able to change directions when they collide into each other, as well as the boundaries.
